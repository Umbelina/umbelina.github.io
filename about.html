      <h2>About</h2>      
      <p>I am a dedicated backend developer with over 3 years of experience in crafting robust and high-performance systems. 
        My proficiency in C# and .NET has empowered me to contribute to large-scale projects, implementing solutions that enhance 
        application scalability and security by up to 56%.</p>
      
      <p>My technical journey is complemented by a deep passion for agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, which drive my ability 
        to deliver rapid and effective results within collaborative teams. I am committed to applying best development practices and 
        leveraging modern tools such as Azure DevOps and Git to maintain code quality and consistency.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to my professional skills, I believe in constantly learning and growing. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies,
        such as learning Swift to expand my programming knowledge. Outside of tech, I am passionate about playing guitar, traveling, and watching 
        movies—hobbies that help me stay creative and energized.</p>
      <p>Whether tackling complex challenges or optimizing existing systems, I bring a proactive approach and a dedication to excellence. I am excited to connect with others who share a passion for technology, innovation, and continuous learning.</p>
